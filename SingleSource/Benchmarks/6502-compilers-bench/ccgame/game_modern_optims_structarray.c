/*
 * ilmenit's sample benchmark in the "how to optimize for cc65" tutorial.
 *
 * original: https://github.com/ilmenit/CC65-Advanced-Optimizations/blob/master/01-start/game.c
 * (first step, without optimization)
 *
 * Changes from original:
 *  - Benchmark framework replaced by a call to a dummy routine (the emulator does the bench in our case)
 *  - atari.h dependency replaced by a constant to a memory area for the screen
 *  - Removed useless semicolon after functions
 *  - Less unused space on screen (screen entirely fits 2 pages)
 *
 * This is the first onoptimized example on which we added big optimizations with modern compilers in mind
 *
 * Optimization done:
 *  - heavy use of static and const (technically equivalent to "tip 12 - inlining everything by hand", without readability loss)
 *  - favor uint8_t to int when possible (tip 03 - Smallest possible unsigned data types)
 *  - gamestate initialization by return value (aesthetics, should not impact performance)
 *  - variables initialized in for loop (aesthetics, should not impact performance)
 *
 *  - structs of array (tip 05 - Replace "array of structs" to "struct of arrays")
 *    - Wast cycles with gcc
 *  - (not done) lookup tables (tip 09 - Replace calculations, switches, and screen access by using Lookup Tables)
 *
